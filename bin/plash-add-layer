# usage: plash-add-layer PARENT-CONTAINER IMPORT-DIR
# Stack a layer on top of a container.  Please note that it uses the rename
# syscall, this means your IMPORT-DIR will be moved into the plash data
# directory.  The container "0" is the empty root container, use that to start
# a container from scratch.
#
#
# Examples:
#
# Create a container from a complete root file system:
# $ plash-add-layer 0 /tmp/rootfs
# 66
#
# Add a new layer on top of an existing container:
# $ plash-add-layer 33 /tmp/mylayer
# 67
