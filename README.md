# plash
is a container build and runtime system.

## Install
```
python3 -m pip install plash
```

## Why Plash?

#### Runs anywhere
Plash's only requirements are python3, a linux kernel (>= 3.18) and a rudimentary mount binary in `$PATH`. It does not need an extra daemon and can be easily run in infrastructure not meant to support containers like virtually any ci environment, embedded systems or even docker containers.

#### Security
Plash can be used completely unprivileged (with `unionfs-fuse` and `newuidmap` as dependencies).

#### Its just processes
Plash containers are processes exactly like you know them. They can be listed with ps, `kill`ed, you can filter for stderr or pipe to stdin, manage them in groups with `supervisord` and `runit` or simply access files in your home directory. Graphical applications just work. Only parts of the filesystem are isolated. More isoalition could be provided by seperate tools.

#### Plashfiles
Plashfiles are executable build files featuring optional lightweight configuration management capabilities.

```
# don't forget to run init first.
$ plash init

# build a simple image
$ plash build --from alpine --run 'touch /file'

--> touch /file

# second build is cached
$ plash build --from alpine --run 'touch /file'
2

# layering is explicit
$ plash build --from alpine --run 'touch /file' --layer --run 'touch /file2'
--> touch /file2
--:
3

# delete a container
$ plash rm 3

# build and run in one command
$ plash run --from alpine --run 'touch /file' -- ls /file
/file

# plash actually includes some configuration management
$ plash run --from alpine --apk git -- git --version
--> apk update

## Other topics

### Plashfiles
Plashfiles are executable build files and may have many use cases. For example packaging scripts or bigger programs in a portable way. The following plash script for example will run a sample application with a graphical user interface.
```
#!/usr/bin/env plash-exec

--from ubuntu

--apt
python3-gi
python3-click
python3-gi-cairo
python3-cairo
gir1.2-gtk-3.0

--layer

--entrypoint-script 
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from gi.repository import Gtk 
win = Gtk.Window()
# create a label
label = Gtk.Label(label="Hello from inside your container")
win.add(label)
win.connect("destroy", Gtk.main_quit)
win.show_all()
Gtk.main()
```
As the project grows, you could decouple the source coe from the build scirpt like this.
```
#!/usr/bin/env plash-exec

--from ubuntu

--apt
python3-gi
python3-click
python3-gi-cairo
python3-cairo
gir1.2-gtk-3.0

--layer

--# invalidates the build cache if the source code is changed
--hash-path ./src

--run
cp -vr ./src /opt/mygui
--entrypoint /opt/mygui/start.py
```                               

### Philosophy
Plash thrives to not be more than a useful tool. There is no monetization strategy, bundling or closed source. It plays well with other software in the ecosystem. Plash and its internal architecture tries to honor the "Do One Thing and Do It Well" UNIX philosophy. This software tries to not "oversell" its abstraction layer, which is containerization of processes. Containerization and isolation are seen as two different tasks, but as a flexible tool this software does not enforce any specific why of using it. Sloppily speaking: after we had a revolutionary containerization of processes with docker, this is also some needed fine adjusting: a *processisation of containers*.
Plash tries to be very maintainable and is designed to still securely run without any changes in 5 or 10 years. This software tries to be in every aspect of the word lightweight. For example by covering less complicated use cases for
containers, like letting a user quickly use a newer software package from another distribution in a sane way. Or being easy to install. Last but not least in a new and fast-moving container world the focus is on boring long term stability and backwards compatibility, starting from version 1.0.

### Development Guidelines
- Keep the script character.
- Don't fall in love with the code, embrace its absence.
- All dependencies will get unmaintained at some point.
- Use honest thin wrappers, documented leaky abstractions are better then difficult promises.
- Don't be a monolith but don't try too hard not to be one.
- Only be as smart as necessary and keep it simple and stupid (KISS).
- Do it or don't do it, but never complain or warn via stderr, nobody cares.
- Still be able to run this in five years without any maintenance work.
- Find out what this program is and especially what it not is.
- Say no to features, say yes to solved used cases.
- Delay compromises.
- Be as vanilla as you can be
- Be humble, don't oversell your abstraction layer.
- Work toward a timeless finished product that will require no maintainance.
- The right guidelines for the right situation.

## FAQ

#### Can I contribute?
Please! Write me an mail plash@irae.me, open an issue, do a pull request or or ask me out for a friendly chat about plash in Berlin.

#### Who are you?
A Django/Python software-developer. Since this is an open source project I hope this software grows organically and collaboratively.

#### Why did you write it?
In my personal opinion Docker is revolutionary but has some shortcomings: awkward interface, reinvention of established software or interfaces, bundling, vendor lock in and overengineering. In a way it kills it's idea by trying too hard to build a huge company on top of it. Plash thrives to not to be more than a useful tool with one task: Building and running containerized processes. Ultimately I wanted something I can if necessary maintain by myself.

#### How does the code base look?
One python3 library without dependencies and one python3 script per command.

#### It's actually just a chrooted process?
Yes, also a container build engine, frameworkish features, some new ideas, some glue and technical subtleties.

#### Is this a replacement for docker?
No. There are no efforts to implement features like image distribution, process management, or orchestration in plash.  Instead it works nicely with docker or other software in the ecosystem. You can use plash to run docker in your system or run your plash containers inside docker. If you for exampling are using docker but want to have containers inside your docker container, you could use plash. You can also access docker images from plash or export plash images to docker. So another use case is to build docker images inside docker containers. They are two software with completely different philosophies. In my opinion docker is kind of a big framework that tries to solve all your container related problems. Plash on the other hand tries to be a flexible minimalistic command line tool that is only concerned with the essential needs of using containers. Both approaches are totally valid and very different. Comparing the code base between the two projects is also difficult, plash is currently only developed by one person.

#### Can I run this in production?
No. Not yet.

#### Is plash secure?
Plash does not use any privileged daemons or have its own setuid helper binaries. Note that plash does not try to isolate containers (which are just normal processes). That means that running a program inside plash is *not* a security feature. Running any container software introduces more entities to trust, that is the root file system image with its additional linux distribution and its own package manager. Using a program from alpine edge could be considered less secure than a package from debian stable or vice versa. Also note that keeping containers updated is more difficult than keeping "normal" system software updated. Plash uses unmodified lxc images and checks their signatures with gpgv if available. Using plash as root should be avoided and should not be necessary for most use cases.

#### When will be the 1.0 release?
There is a Github project for this: https://github.com/ihucos/plash/projects/1
