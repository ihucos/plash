Keep the script charachter.
Don't fall in love with the code, embrace its absence.
Don't be a monolothit but don't try not to be one.
Others will interface with you over system resources, not libraries. Eat your own dog food on this.
Honest thin wrappers, documented leaky abstractions are better then difficult promises.
Only be as smart as neccesary and keep it simple and stupid (KISS)
Say no to features, say yes to solved used cases.
The right three tools for the right job.
Find out what this program is and especially what it not is.
Delay compromisses.

Make using it feel good.
Even the geek user does not care, it should just work.
Programm this for someone you know, yourself is also fine.

Still be able to run this in five years without any maintance work.
high-level goal: user experience and maintability, maybe compability.
The right guidelines for the right situation.
