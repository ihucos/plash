# Why plash?
###

- Security: plash containers run completely in user space.

- portability: Plash runs inside CI environments and inside other container software
  like docker.

- Integration: Processes are containerized but still interact naturally with the host
  operating system.

- Plashfiles: Plashfiles are executable build files featuring an extendable
  lightweight configuration management language.


###
# Getting started
###

$ pip3 install plash
$ plash --from alpine --apk xeyes -- xeyes
$ plash --from-github ihucos/python --pip3 dotfiles -- dotfiles --sync
$ plash --help


###
# Examples
###

https://github.com/ihucos/noapt                        Use ubuntu packages in other Linux distributions
https://github.com/ihucos/plash-travis-example         Run plash in travis CI
https://github.com/ihucos/plash-python-example/        Example of OS-Level isolation of python packages

###
# Plashfiles
###

Plashfiles are executable build files and may have many use cases. For example
packaging scripts or bigger programs in a portable way. Here is an example:

$ cat $HOME/bin/gtk-hello-world
#!/usr/bin/env plash-exec
--from archlinux
--pacman gtk3 python-gobject
--layer
--entrypoint-script 
#!/usr/bin/env python
import gi
gi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0')
from gi.repository import Gtk
Gtk.init(None)
Hello = Gtk.MessageDialog(message_type=Gtk.MessageType.INFO,
                          buttons=Gtk.ButtonsType.OK,
                          text="Hello world!",
                          secondary_text="This is running inside a plash container.")
Hello.run()


###
# Development Guidelines
###

- Keep the script character.
- Don't fall in love with the code, embrace its absence.
- All dependencies will get unmaintained at some point.
- Use honest thin wrappers, documented leaky abstractions are better then difficult promises.
- Don't be a monolith but don't try too hard not to be one.
- Only be as smart as necessary and keep it simple and stupid (KISS).
- Do it or don't do it, but never complain or warn via stderr.
- Still be able to run this in five years without any maintenance work.
- Find out what this program is and especially what it not is.
- Say no to features, say yes to solved used cases.
- Postpone compromises.
- Be as vanilla as you can be
- Be humble, don't oversell your abstraction layer.
- Work toward a timeless, finished product that will require no maintainance.
- The right guidelines for the right situation.

# FAQ
###

* Can I contribute?
Please! Write me an mail mail@irae.me, open an issue, do a pull request or ask
me out for a friendly chat about plash in Berlin.

* Who are you?
A Django/Python software-developer. Since this is an open source project I hope
this software grows organically and collaboratively.

* Why did you write it?
Technical idealism. I wanted a better technical solution for a problem. In my
personal opinion Docker is revolutionary but has some shortcomings: awkward
interface, reinvention of established software or interfaces, bundling, vendor
lock in and overengineering. In a way it kills it's idea by trying too hard to
build a huge company on top of it. Plash thrives to not to be more than a
useful tool with one task: Building and running containerized processes.
Ultimately I wanted something I can if necessary maintain by myself.

* Are there plans to commercialise this?
No, there isn't. I want to write a core software that is "finished" at some
point and serves well for a long time. But at the same time I don't want to
risk disappointing anyone and am not making any absolute guarantees. In any
case commercialising open source Software can very easily lead to a worse
product.

* What is the Licence?
The MIT Licence.

* How does the code look?
One python3 library without dependencies and one standalone script per
subcommand. Counting the whole repository its just less than 5000 lines. I am
planning to slowly rewrite part by part in C. But first I must learn C properly
:-)

* How does plash compare to Docker?
There are no efforts to implement features like image distribution, process
management, or orchestration in plash. Instead plash works nicely with docker
or other software in the ecosystem. You can use plash to run docker in your
system or run your plash containers inside docker. If you for exampling are
using docker but want to have containers inside your docker container, you
could use plash. You can also access docker images from plash or export plash
images to docker. Another use case is to build docker images inside docker
containers.  They are two software with completely different philosophies.
Docker is kind of a big framework that tries to solve all your container
related problems. Plash on the other hand tries to be a flexible minimalistic
command line tool that is only concerned with the essential needs of using
containers. Both approaches are totally valid and very different. Comparing the
code base between the two projects is also difficult.

* Can I run this in production?
You can (FIXE: NO YOU CANT, remove fixme after 1.0 release). It probably still
has some warts, what I can guarantee is to enthusiastically support this
software and all issues that may come with it and focus on backward
compatibility.

* Is plash secure?
Plash does not use any privileged daemons or have its own setuid helper
binaries. Note that plash does not try to isolate containers (which are just
normal processes). That means that running a program inside plash is not a
security feature. Running any container software introduces more entities to
trust, that is the root file system image with its additional linux
distribution and its own package manager. Using a program from alpine edge
could be considered less secure than a package from debian stable or vice
versa. Also note that keeping containers updated is more difficult than keeping
"normal" system software updated. Furthermore note that programs could not be
used to run inside semi-isolated containers and behave oddly. Plash uses
unmodified lxc images and checks their signatures with gpgv (if in PATH). Using
plash as root should be avoided and should not be necessary for most use cases.
Until now plash was written by one person and of course I could be wrong about
something. But generally speaking it really should be good enough.

* When will be the 1.0 release?
Very Soon, there is a Github project for this: https://github.com/ihucos/plash/projects/1
